# Training

## Project Setup
1. Need to have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) on path
2.Clone project
3.Run `poetry install` in project

To run the script - `poetry run python Trainer.py`

**Note**

we do want poetry.lock files in repo. If a project dependency needs to be updated the lock file should be pushed to git
