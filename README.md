# Training

## Project Setup
1. Need to have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) on path
2. Clone project
3. Run `poetry install` in project

To run the script - `poetry run python Trainer.py`

**Note**

we do want the poetry.lock file in repo. It is what keeps track of project dependency versions for the `poetry install` command to install. If a project dependency needs to be updated the lock file should be pushed to git.
